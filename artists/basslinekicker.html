    	<h1>BasslinePuncher</h1>
    	BasslinePuncher, known for his 'The Grill' remix by Earthberg, has punched the basslines of many
        people and for that reason alone,
        is an artist over here at Bronze Skies Records! He has released Inspire with an artist called Extra (who no one really knows tbh.)
